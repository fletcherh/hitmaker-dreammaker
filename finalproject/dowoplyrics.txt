In the still of the night
I held you
Held you tight
'Cause I love
Love you so
Promise I'll never
Let you go
In the still of the night
I remember
That night in May
The stars were bright above
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep
Your precious love
Well before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still of the night
So before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
Earth angel, earth angel
Will you be mine?
My darling dear
Love you all the time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you
The one I adore
Love you forever and ever more
I fell for you and I knew
The vision of your love-loveliness
I hoped and I pray that someday
I'll be the vision of your hap-happiness oh, oh, oh, oh!
My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear
The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
Maybe you'll think of me
When you are all alone
Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
Then what will you do
Maybe you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe
I don't ever care to rise to power
I would rather be with you an hour
For the things that one can buy
Are not worth a lover's sigh
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me
The closer you are
The brighter, the stars in the sky
And darling, I realize
You're the one in my life for
My heart skips a beat every time
You and I meet my life, my love, my dear
I can't defeat that yearning deep
In my heart to have only you
When I first saw you
I did adore you any others beware
And then you went away but now you're back to stay
And my love for you grows stronger every day
The brighter, the flames in my heart
And darling, we'll never part
We'll always be in love
Cry, cry, cry whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Cry, cry, cry whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
There is a story 
That I must tell
Of two lovers
That I knew well
Now they must cry, cry, cry whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Their blues away
(Cry cry cry their blues away)
Her name was Sue
His name was Earl
His love was Lorraine
She's a wonderful girl
But they must cry, cry, cry whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Their blues away
(Their blues away)
Love will make you happy
And love will make you cry
Love will make the tears fall
When your lover says goodbye
And then you'll cry, cry, cry whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Your blues away
(Cry cry cry their blues away)
This story ends here
It was no lie
Names have been changed dear
To protect you and I
But we must cry, cry, cry whoa-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Our blues away
(Cry cry cry)
Mmm (whoa-uh our blues away)
We must cry
(Cry cry cry whoa-uh our blues away)
Could this be magic
My dear
My heart's all aglow
Could this be magic
Loving you so
Could this be magic
My dear
Having your love
My prayers were answered
So far from above
I thought it would be
Just a memory
To linger my heart in pain
But to my surprise
I opened up my eyes
And I'm with you dear once again
Could this be magic
My dear
Having your love
If this is magic
Then magic is mine
Could this be magic
Then magic is mine
See the pyramids along the Nile 
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me.
See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
But remember when a dream appears
You belong to me.
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too---and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
I don't have happiness, and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Just to be with you
Just to be with you
There is nothing I wouldn`t do
Just to be with you.
I`d climb a mountain or sail the seas
I`d go a thousand miles upon my knees
I`d find a rainbow and take it from the sky
I`ll be a slave till the day I die.
I`ll build a castle, like those of old,
And I would fill it with wealth untold,
I`d find the lion, compose a symphony,
I`ll count the stars in the galaxy.
