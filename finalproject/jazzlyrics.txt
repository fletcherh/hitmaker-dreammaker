Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Pastoral scene of the gallant South
The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop
Won't you stop and take
A little time out with me
Just take five
Stop your busy day
And take the time out
To see if I'm alive
Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play
Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way
Wouldn't it be better
Not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now
It's alright, just take five
Just take five
Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play
Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way
Wouldn't it be better
Not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now
It's alright, just take five
Just take five
You must take the "A" train
To go to Sugar Hill way up in Harlem
If you miss the "A" train
You`ll find you missed the quickest way to Harlem
Hurry, get on, now it`s coming
Listen to those rails a-thrumming
All aboard, get on the "A" train
Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem
Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush, little baby; don't you cry
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by

In a Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing since you
Made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd be
Loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing since you
Made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt that you'd be
Loving sentimental me
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
My heart is sad and lonely 
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven´t you seen it
I´m all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin´
And wondering why it´s me you´re hopin´
I tell you I mean it
I´m all for you body and soul
I can´t believe it
It´s hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
And less I could have one more chance to prove, dear
My life a wreck you´re making
You know I´m yours for just the taking
I´d gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you´re making
You know I´m yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
Cigarette holder- which wigs me
Over her shoulder - she digs me
Out cattin' - that satin doll
Baby shall we go - out skippin'
Careful amigo - you're flippin'
Speaks Latin - that satin doll
She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me
Telephone numbers - well you know
Doing my rhumbas - with uno
And that'n my satin doll
